Operating Systems are what translates the things you see and do, to the computer so it can understand it. It then translates the computer's output back to you in a way you can understand. #expression:neutral
There are three main Operating Systems used today. Windows, macOS, and Linux
Windows is from Microsoft. It is the most common Operating System (or OS) for non-Apple computers.
macOS is from Apple, and it can only be used by Apple brand computers. If you own a MAC PC or a MacBook, it is running macOS.
The last one is Linux. Linux is an open source, free alternative to Windows. It's less user friendly than windows, and has less support for some applications, but it also offers a lot more freedom in what can be done with it.
