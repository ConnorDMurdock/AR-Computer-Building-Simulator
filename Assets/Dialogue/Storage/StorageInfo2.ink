Good job! Now that the HDD is installed, let's move on to the Solid-State Drive, also known as a SSD. #expression:neutral
There are many differences between a SSD and a HDD. For one, the SSD works much, much faster. It doesn't use a metal disk like the HDD does, which speeds up file transferring, reading, and writing.
However, SSDs are also more expensive than a HDD. We'll talk more about this soon.
For now, let's go ahead and install the SSD. The installation method is similar to the HDD, only the SSD isn't installed in trays, but screwed in elsewhere in the case.
It is still plugged into the power supply and motherboard, so be sure to plug it in properly! #expression:error
