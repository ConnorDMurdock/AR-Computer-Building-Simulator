This is a HDD, or a Hard Disk Drive. It is where all the data and files on your computer are stored. #expression:neutral
It uses a large spinning metal disk in order to save your files and read them later. Without it, your computer wouldn't be able to save anything!
One very important note about HDDs is that the metal disk is sensitive to magnets! So keep all magnets away from your computer, or you can risk Hard Drive Failure and lose all your files! #expression:error
To install the HDD, there is usually a special tray in the case where they are installed. After they are in the tray, they just need to be plugged into the power supply and the motherboard.
