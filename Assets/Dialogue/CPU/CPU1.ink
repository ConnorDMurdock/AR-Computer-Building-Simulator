This is the Central Processing Unit, commonly referred to as the CPU. You can think of it as the brain of the computer. #expression:neutral
The CPU is the most important component of any computer. Without it, the computer wouldn't be able to work at all.
On the underside of the CPU are many tiny pins that are slotted into that square shaped spot near the top of the motherboard.
There is a small lever next to the square that must be lifted up before attempting to place the CPU in. After the CPU is in place, the lever is pushed down and the CPU snaps into place.
It is VERY important that the pins are not bent while installing! If one of the pins gets bent, it can cause the CPU to not work and, in turn, cause the whole computer to not work! #expression:error
The CPU also has a small arrow in one corner on the top. This is because there is one corner of the CPU where the pin shape is different, and this must match up with the arrow on the motherboard. #expression:neutral
So please, be careful when installing the CPU. Don't bend the pins, make sure the arrows match, and you'll have no problems.
