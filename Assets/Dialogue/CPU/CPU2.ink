Great work! The CPU is now in place. #expression:neutral
There are some important aspects of CPUs to look out for when purchasing one. CPUs can either be single-core or multi-core.
A multi-core CPU can handle more tasks at the same time than a single-core CPU, however it requires more power to run and needs more cooling.
It is important that your power supply is powerful enough and that you have proper cooling for your CPU! Otherwise it can overheat and break. #expression:error
Unfortunately, this is the end of the demo for now. We are hard at work preparing the rest of the lessons to create a complete and informative experience! #expression:neutral
In the meantime, feel free to get a close look at the parts installed so far, and have fun with the AR aspect of the app!
We truly hope you've enjoyed the app so far, and we look forward to seeing you again when the app is complete! #expression:happy
