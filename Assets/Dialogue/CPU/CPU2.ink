Great work! The CPU is now in place. #expression:neutral
There are some important aspects of CPUs to look out for when purchasing one. CPUs can either be single-core or multi-core.
A multi-core CPU can handle more tasks at the same time than a single-core CPU, however it requires more power to run and needs more cooling.
It is important that your power supply is powerful enough and that you have proper cooling for your CPU! Otherwise, it can overheat and break. #expression:error
