This is a Graphics Card. As the name suggests, this component is responsible for rendering graphics. #expression:neutral
Most motherboards come with a graphics card already installed, and for most simple applications like the Microsoft Office suite of software, this is sufficient.
However, for software like video editing software, games, digital illustration, and more, it may be necessary to upgrade your graphics card, with one like this.
To install this graphics card, and any other kinds of "expansion card" components (this includes graphics cards, sound cards, and network interface cards) you have to plug it into the PCI/PCIe slots.
PCI stands for "peripheral component interconnect" and PCIe stands for "peripheral component interconnect express". PCIe is simply a higher bandwidth version of PCI, and is more common nowadays while also being compatible with PCI cards too.
These slots can usually be found underneath the CPU, and the case will have special holes you can create for the cards you install. This is because most of these cards will have special ports you need to plug your peripherals into for them to work (more on this later!).
Let's go ahead and install the Graphics Card now! #expression:happy
