Hello! My name is CARL: Computer-building Assistant and Robotic Lecturer. #expression:neutral
My goal is to teach students about the different parts of a computer and how to build one themselves by using Augmented Reality! #expression:happy
As you can see, this is quite a different way of teaching than this app used to have. #expression:neutral
My creator was unhappy with the previous system, since students would just see a block of text and feel bored #expression:error
However, now that I'm here, students can be taught directly by a friendly robot! #expression:happy
As you can see, I have a range of expressions to help create a dynamic experience. I also give the illusion of speaking by using some cute robotic beeps! #expression:neutral
It has the additonal feature of preventing students from skipping all the text. They can't move on to the next textbox until I'm done speaking.
For now, this is all I can show, as I'm currently hard at work implementing the rest of the features into the app in time for Create. #expression:error
However, I will do my best to continue bringing new and exciting updates to you. #expression:neutral
I hope you like the new presentation! Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions! #expression:happy
