Alright! That's the most important peripherals covered. #expression:neutral
There are many different types of monitors, mouse, keyboards, and USB sticks out there. The most important factor can vary between all of them as well.
Generally speaking, you want a monitor that is at least 1920x1080 resolution (measured in pixels) and 60Hz. 60Hz is the refresh rate, which is basically how many "frames" the computer can show per second. A 60Hz monitor will show at 60 frames per second.
When purchasing a mouse or a keyboard, comfort is most important. You should be able to use them for long periods of time without discomfort. #expression:error
USB sticks are generally measured in Gigabytes nowadays, just like storage. The larger the storage, the higher the price tag. #expression:neutral
