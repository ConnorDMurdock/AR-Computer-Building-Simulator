Great work! The RAM is now installed. #expression:happy
Alongside RAM, there is also ROM, which stands for "Read-Only Memory". ROM is similar to RAM, except rather than only stores information short term, it stores information long term. #expression:neutral
ROM can usually be found as chips on the motherboard. They aren't generally a part you have to install or upgrade like RAM.
Unlike the data stored in RAM, which is wiped once you restart your computer, the data in ROM is kept permanently. It's useful for things that your computer always needs access to, like your startup applications.
The most important factor when purchasing RAM, is the amount. RAM is sold in sticks that have "Gigabytes", or GB, of memory.
It is generally advised to have at least 8 GB of RAM for most applications. Though more intense applications like video editing software and gaming will perform better with 16 GB of RAM or more.
Now that the RAM is installed, let's move on to the Graphics Card!
