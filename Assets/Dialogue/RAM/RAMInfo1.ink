This is the Random Access Memory chip, also known as RAM! #expression:neutral
It gives your computer the short term memory that it uses for all of its functions. It's extremely important for a computer.
You can think of it like doing math in your head. You can figure out what 3 + 10 is without needing to write it down or remember it forever. Once you solve the problem, you can forget about the equation and focus on something else.
RAM comes in these "sticks" that are installed directly on the motherboard, usually in slots near the CPU.
To install them, you just have to line them up correctly, and push them in until you hear a click.
Let's give it a try! #expression:happy
