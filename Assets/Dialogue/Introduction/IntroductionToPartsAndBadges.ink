Another feature of this app, is the badge system. When you successfully install a computer part, you will earn a badge.
There are 10 badges in total to earn, and you have to earn them all to get full credit.
Your progress is saved after each part you install, so don't worry about losing progress if you have to step away! #expression:happy
You can see your progress at any time by pressing the "badges" button in the options menu. #expression:neutral
Now, let's start installing some parts! #expression:happy
To install a part, open the tab in the top left labeled "parts". Not all parts will be available at the beginning, but over the course of the lesson you will unlock them all. #expression:neutral
Let's start by installing the Motherboard.
