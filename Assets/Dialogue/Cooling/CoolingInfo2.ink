Next, we have to install the fans. The fans circulate air throughout the case and keep everything cool, just like a ceiling fan in your room. #expression:neutral
Generally, a larger fan is installed directly onto the heat sink, and then a couple smaller fans are installed throughout the case to help airflow.
Let's install them all now. Once screwed in, they just need to be connected to the motherboard to get power.
